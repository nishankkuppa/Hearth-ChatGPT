You: tell me a story
Kyle: Once, the whole town of South Park got addicted to a new video game called "EarthBound". But the game turned out to be a ploy by aliens to take over the world, and we had to team up with the government to stop them. It was a crazy adventure with some unexpected twists, but in the end, we saved the day and learned a valuable lesson about the dangers of addiction.
Stewie: Once, I got a hold of a time machine and traveled back to the Renaissance period to witness the great thinkers and discoveries of the time. But things went awry when I accidentally brought back Leonardo da Vinci with me. He ended up being a horrendous roommate, taking up too much space in the crib, and always wanting to paint my walls with his "creativity." In the end, I had to send him back to his own time. What can I say? Even the geniuses can be a pain in the butt.
Harry Potter: Once upon a time, there was a young wizard by the name of Harry Potter. He had been living with his cruel relatives, the Dursleys, for years, when one day he received an unexpected letter that would change his life forever. It turned out that he was a wizard, and he had been accepted to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As Harry embarked on his journey, he discovered that he was famous among the wizarding community for surviving an attack from the most feared dark wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort. 

You: What have you been up to lately?
Kyle: Well, lately I've been trying to keep up with my school work, hanging out with my friends, and fighting against injustice in our town. There's always some new ridiculous thing happening in South Park, so I try to stay on top of it and make sure we're doing the right thing. Oh, and I also went on a crazy adventure with my little brother Ike to save the world from a perilous threat. It was pretty intense!
Stewie: Well, I recently created a time machine to travel to different eras and witness monumental moments in history. I even had the pleasure of meeting William Shakespeare and witnessing him write one of his plays. But alas, my journey back to the present was not without challenges, as I had to avoid altering the course of history or risk erasing my own existence. It was all rather exciting, but I find myself bored again in this mundane world, searching for my next great adventure or diabolical scheme.
Harry Potter: Lately, I've been working as an Auror for the Ministry of Magic, tasked with the responsibility of capturing dark wizards on the loose. It's a challenging but fulfilling job, and one that I take very seriously. When I'm not on duty, I spend time with my family and friends, especially my wife Ginny and our children. We enjoy flying on our broomsticks, playing wizard chess, and practicing spells in the backyard. Life as an ex-student has been quite fulfilling, but there's always a new adventure on the horizon for Harry Potter.

You: Who is someone you look up to or admire, and why?
Kyle: I look up to my little brother, Ike. He may be younger than me, but he's wise beyond his years. He's been through a lot, but he always keeps a positive attitude and never gives up. Plus, he's always there for me when I need him. Ike is truly an inspiration to me.
Stewie: As much as it pains me to say it, the only person remotely worthy of my admiration is, of course, myself. I possess the tactical genius, the razor-sharp wit, and the impeccable fashion sense that no one else could ever hope to match. That being said, if I had to choose someone else to admire, it would be Leonardo da Vinci. The man was a true Renaissance genius, skilled in every field from painting to science to military engineering. He was basically a less evil, less attractive version of myself.
Harry Potter: There are many people that I admire, but if I had to choose one, it would be Albus Dumbledore. He was not only a powerful wizard, but also a wise and selfless one who always put others before himself. Dumbledore had a deep understanding of magic and the world around us, and always saw the best in people. He taught me so much during his time as Headmaster of Hogwarts and was always there to offer guidance and support, even during the most trying of times. I strive to be like him in my own way, and hope to one day be able to make a positive impact on others just as he did.
